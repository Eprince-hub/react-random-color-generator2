# React Random Color Generator

This a Random color generator that is made in React.js and for now it only has a simple functionality that allows the user to generate a random color anytime the generate color button is clicked.

I will love to add more functionality later that would allow the user to select the hue and luminosity and also generate a custom color box and that will be on my todo list for this web app.

suggestions and contributions are welcome.
